# Install the mysqli extension, which is essential for PHP to communicate with MySQL.
# We chain the commands using '&&' to minimize image layers and ensure efficiency.
# The 'docker-php-ext-install' command is the standard way to install PHP extensions 
# in the official PHP Docker images.
RUN docker-php-ext-install mysqli \

# Copy the contents of the local 'web' directory into the Apache document root 
# inside the container (/var/www/html/). This makes the application accessible.
COPY web/ /var/www/html/

# The base image (php:8.2-apache) automatically handles exposing port 80 
# and starting the Apache web server, so no explicit CMD or EXPOSE instructions are needed.
# This results in a minimal and efficient Dockerfile.
