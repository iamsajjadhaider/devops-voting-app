# Use the official MySQL 8.0 image as the base.
FROM mysql:8.0

# Copy the local initialization script ('db/init.sql') into the special 
# directory '/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/' inside the container.
# The official MySQL image automatically executes any .sql or .sh files 
# found here on the very first start-up, setting up the database schema and initial data.
COPY db/init.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/

# The base image already exposes port 3306 and handles the CMD to start 
# the MySQL server, keeping this Dockerfile concise and efficient.
